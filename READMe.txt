This documentation is to explain how to run the Dijkstra algorithm for path planning course (ENPM-661 Project-2)

implmentation.py file is the main file.
Priority_queue.py is a sub-file that contains the class priority queue.


Priority_queue.py file is imported into the implementation.py file to use the class object priority queue.

Maze in this file is fixed but can be altered for future purposes by changing the inputs such as array dimensions
and describing points and equations of the perimeter lines of the obstacles.
Dijkstra's algorithm function is also reusable. It takes start position coordinates, goal position coordinates, 
and an array of the maze.

Finally, to run the file:

-> Import the project folder.
-> Run the implentation.py file 
-> Choose points on the image of the map.
-> Watch the search algorithm run. ((observe video:result1))
-> If in haste, press 'q' to just see the path. ((watch: result2))
